Information on the run_analysis script.

The script performs the reading (from the website) and cleaning of a dataset related to mobile phone sensor data linked to activity performed while executing the activity.

Since the original analysis was a machine-learining model, original data was split in data set and test set, many features were extracted, and output data (activity performed) are in separate files. The script accumulates all of the data in a single , cleaned data set.
Moreover, an average aggreagte is computed over such cleaned dataset.
